## Abandonâ€ƒhopeâ€ƒallâ€ƒyeâ€ƒwhoâ€ƒenterâ€ƒhereâ€ƒ...

Welcome to my page, dear reader. My name is Beladonna, I am a Romani-English fag transsexual vampire born in the late February of 1808. I use feminine pronouns. I am a Pisces sun, a Scorpio moon and an Aries rising.

I take a keen interest in body modification, riddles, macabre fiction and the grotesque intricacies of the human mind. My favourite genres of music are industrial metal, gothic rock and new wave, but I listen to everything.

I am a Yumejoshi, my husband is Franco Barbi from the video game Outlast Trials <3 I adore that disgusting freak of a man.

Involved in the Goth and alternative community from the age of 210.

## Heedâ€ƒmyâ€ƒwarningâ€ƒ...

Please do not interact with me if you involve yourself in petty internet discourse. I have no opinion on someone's identity, attraction or consumption of media.

That being said, I do not support endogenic systems. If you genuinely believe you are a system of endogenic origin, I recommend going to therapy. 

I can become defensive about my interests and favourite characters, please don't speak negatively about them in front of me.

I have OCD, BPD, ADHD and autism. I am also the host of a P-DID system. My conditions affect the way I perceive the world and interact with others.
